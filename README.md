===================

Hello, 

This is what I made:

To start off I created a virtual environment (named marksenv)
	In this virtual environment I created a project (named ProjectM)
		In the prjectM folder I created a poll named Markspoll   

		TO CHECK OUT THE RESULT! 
		--> run the server by typing $ python manage.py runserver
